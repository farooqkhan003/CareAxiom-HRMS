Kindly follow the mentioned (rough and incomplete) steps **IN ORDER** to setup project. You may choose any operating environment, i.e `Windows` or `Linux`. Though Linux will be preferred. Note that these steps are specific to `Ubuntu`. Other operating systems may differ slightly.

###### Kindly ask me if there is some confusion regarding these steps. Since they are not detailed, therefore there is a good chance of making mistake if you are setting up Git and project for the first time.

###### Cloning the project
1) Download and install `github` <br />
2) Make a directory where you would like your project to reside. <br />
3) [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the [repository](https://github.com/khanshab003/CareAxiom-HRMS) to your local directory. <br />

###### Installing the node modules
1) Install `npm` and `nodejs`. <br />
2) Open terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Type `npm install`. <br />

###### Setting up database explorer
1) Install MySQL ([Ubuntu](https://www.linode.com/docs/databases/mysql/install-mysql-on-ubuntu-14-04) or [Windows](https://corlewsolutions.com/articles/article-21-how-to-install-mysql-server-5-6-on-windows-7-development-machine)). <br />
2) You can optionally install [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/), which is a visual database explorer. <br />

###### Working with the project
1) You can use an IDE for development purposes. I shall recommend [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) which has 1 year free license for students. <br />
2) Open your project on WebStorm or on any IDE/Editor. <br />
3) Open terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Make a new branch through `git checkout -b <new-branch>` and start committing to it. Other commands that you will require are: <br />
  ```
  git status
  git diff file-or-directory-name
  git add file-or-directory-name
  git commit -m "Reason for commit or change"
  git push origin branch-name
  ```
