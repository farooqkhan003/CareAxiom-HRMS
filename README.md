Kindly follow the mentioned (rough and incomplete) steps to setup project. You may choose any operating environment, i.e `Windows` or `Linux`. Though Linux will be preferred. Note that these steps are specific to `Ubuntu`. Other operating systems may differ slightly.

###### Kindly ask me if there is some confusion regarding these steps. Since they are not detailed, therefore there is a good chance of making mistake if you are setting up Git and project for the first time.

1) Download and install `github`

2) Install `npm` and `nodejs`

3) For your own benefit, try to use an IDE for development purposes. I shall recommend [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) which has 1 year free license for students.

4) Make a directory where you would like your project to reside. Default directory for Webstorm in Ubuntu is **/home/name-of-your-user/WebstormProjects/name-of-your-directory**.

5) [Clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) to your local directory.

6) Open terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Type `npm install`.

7) Make a new branch through `git checkout -b <new-branch>` and start committing to it. Other commands that you will require are:
  ```
  git status
  git diff file-or-directory-name
  git add file-or-directory-name
  git commit -m "Reason for commit or change"
  git push origin branch-name
  ```
