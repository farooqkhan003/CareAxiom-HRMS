Kindly follow the mentioned (rough) steps to setup project. You may choose any operating environment, i.e `Windows` or `Linux`. Though Linux will be preferred. Note that these steps are specific to `Ubuntu`. Other operating systems may differ slightly.

1) Download and install `github`

2) Install `npm` and `nodejs`

3) For your own benefit, try to use an IDE for development purposes. I shall recommend `WebStorm` (https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) which has 1 year free license for students.

4) Make a directory where you would like your project to reside. Default directory for Webstorm in Ubuntu is `/home/name-of-your-user/WebstormProjects/name-of-your-directory`.

5) Clone the repository to your local directory (https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).

6) Open terminal and navigate to your project's root directory. Type `npm install`.
